# Rails Blog: Signing in with Github using Omniauth

This is the sixth iteration of our Blog App.

In our last iteration, we used Sessions and built our own log in system. Instead, we're going to refactor that and create a log in system using OmniAuth. A user should be able to log in / sign up using their Github account.

1. Add the [omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and [omniauth-github](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-github) gems to your Gemfile. Be sure to read the readmes for both.
